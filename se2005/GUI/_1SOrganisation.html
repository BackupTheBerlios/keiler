<h1>Anti-Spyware Coalition Risk Model Description</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The anti-spyware industry offers a robust selection of tools to consumers in the marketplace. As is to be expected in such an environment, the rating systems used to classify Spyware and other Potentially Unwanted Technologies vary between Anti-Spyware vendors. The members of ASC believe that reputable anti-spyware companies should be transparent about their decisions to help users understand how anti-spyware tools make decisions; software publishers understand what may concern users; and Anti-Spyware vendors share information about emerging threats.</p>
<p>To facilitate that transparency, the ASC has developed a list of a broad set of behaviors that its members can use to help users make decisions. We expect the list to change over time as new bad practices are discovered.</p>
<p>ASC is making this draft available for public comment until 11/27. We hope that by including the public in our process, we will come away with a document that will help users to better protect themselves. You can comment on the document via the <a href="http://www.antispywarecoalition.org">ASC Web site</a> &ndash;or via email at asc_comments@cdt.org.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>This document will:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  <li>Outline the common terminology and process for classifying potentially unwanted technologies</li>
  <li>      Describe the behaviors that can lead to detection so that software vendors and users will have a better understanding of the decision-making process</li>
  <li>      Provide an overview of the approaches used to classify a software application</li>
  </ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"> The risk modeling system is based on behavior. The risk and consent factors described below lay the groundwork for the eventual publication of industry-wide Best Practices.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the decision on what rating to give and what risk model to use falls to the individual Anti-Spyware vendor. This decision was intentional, to give each vendor the flexibility to rate software on their own terms while agreeing to a common framework.</p>
<p>Anti-Spyware vendors agree on the basic terminology and factors leading to risk or consent, but will differ on the exact modeling system and thresholds for detection. The variations in modeling help users make better marketplace decisions by selecting products that align with their priorities. The common framework and language regarding risk and consent behaviors helps Anti-Spyware vendors describe their models consistently, and gives standard guidance to application vendors about the factors that may lead to a program being flagged.</p>
<p>The criteria below outline the key factors that members of the Anti-Spyware Coalition use to make a determination &ndash; vendors may decide to use all or a subset of the criteria. In general, a program&rsquo;s rating will increase with risk behaviors, and decrease with behaviors that provide user consent and control.</p>
<h2>Modeling Process Overview</h2>
<p>The risk-modeling process is the method Anti-Spyware vendors use to determine the classification of a program. Members of the Anti-Spyware Coalition use the same essential modeling process:</p>
<ol style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  <li>Determine the installation method used</li>

  <li>      Install and research software to determine areas of impact</li>
  <li>Measure the risk factors</li>
  <li>Measure the consent factors</li>
  <li>Weigh the risk factors against the consent factors to determine what classification and level apply, if any<br>
      </li>
  </ol>

<p style="margin-top: 0;">While Anti-Spyware Coalition members agree on the factors that increase risk or consent, each member weighs and combines these factors on their own scale. Although ratings should not differ greatly, variations are possible because Anti-Spyware products have differing foci and philosophies.</p>
<p>For example, one vendor may not detect a program that tracks the user if such behavior is turned &lsquo;off&rsquo; by default, while another may detect such a program but at a low warning level.</p>
<h2>Overview of the Risk Categories:</h2>
<p>Spyware and other Potentially Unwanted Technologies encompass a wide variety of behaviors that can concern users. To help understand the impact, we can describe software as affecting one or more of the following areas:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Privacy</strong> &ndash; Compromising the user&rsquo;s information or data, such as</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
  <li>        Exposure to fraud or identity theft</li>
  <li>Loss of personal information</li>
  <li>Unauthorized tracking</li>
  </ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Security</strong> &ndash; Impacting the system integrity of the computer, such as</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
  <li>        Attacking the computer, or using it as part of an attack</li>
  <li>Exposing the computer to risk by lowering security settings</li>
  <li>Using computer resources in an unauthorized manner</li>
  <li>Hiding programs from the user<br>
        </li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>User Experience</strong> &ndash; Impacting the user&rsquo;s functionality of the computer, such as<br>
        </p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
  <li>Delivering unexpected advertisements</li>
  <li>Changing settings</li>
  <li>Creating system instability or slowing performance<br>

        </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">These risk categories are not mutually exclusive, and are not limited to the examples above. These represent the general areas Anti-Spyware vendors examine, and help describe the impact to users in common terms.</p>
<p>For example, a program may be detected by an anti-spyware vendor because it intercepts network traffic. The anti-spyware vendor may wish to explain this as an impact to privacy, rather than explaining the details of the underlying technology (which may be described in a more extensive write-up).</p>
<p>To further describe a program, some Anti-Spyware vendors may choose to rate a program along each risk category, while others may merge the categories into a single rating.</p>
<h2>Risk and Consent Factors</h2>
<p>Many applications have complex behavior &ndash; the final determination of a program requires a judgment call on the part of the Anti-Spyware vendor, based on their policies about what programs should be brought to the user&rsquo;s attention. The following are key considerations in the risk modeling process:</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Technologies/Activities are neutral</h3>

<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
  <li>        Technologies and activities like data collection are neutral, and as such are harmful or helpful depending on their context. Anti-Spyware vendors need to consider both the factors that increase risk and the factors that increase consent before making a determination.<br>
      </li>
</ul>
<h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many risk factors can be mitigated</h3>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
  <li>        A risk factor is an indication that a program has certain behavior. The Anti-Spyware vendor must consider this behavior in context and decide whether the consent factors mitigate the risk. Some risk factors may not flag a program on their own, but could be considered in combination with other factors. Certain risk factors are impactful enough that they cannot be mitigated, such as installation by security exploit. The Anti-Spyware vendor may choose to always alert the user about programs with this behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>

    Weights can differ</h3>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
  <li>        Anti-Spyware vendors may weigh behaviors differently, depending on their policies about what behaviors are taken into consideration. Each vendor sets their own threshold for detection based on the weights they assign to the risk and consent factors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
    Strive for objective, consistent rules</h3>
<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
  <li>          The factors outlined below are meant to be objective and easy to apply consistently. However, certain factors cannot be determined programmatically but are still important to users (such as the use of deceptive text or graphics). In these cases, each Anti-Spyware determines the impact according to their internal policies.</li>

  </ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">      The common agreement in the Anti-Spyware Coalition centers on what factors increase risk and what factors increase consent. Therefore, the general advice for an application vendor is to</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  <li>Minimize the risk factors</li>
  <li>Maximize the consent factors</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0;"><br>
    The lists below cover a wide variety of behaviors, and are not exhaustive. They will grow with time as new behaviors emerge.</p>

<h3>Risk Factors</h3>
<p>The following risk factors are behaviors that have the potential for user harm or disruption. In some cases, the behavior may be desired, such as data collection for personalization, but can still present a risk if unauthorized. Many of these risks can be mitigated by providing the appropriate consent factors.</p>
<p>In certain cases, a risk may be serious enough that a vendor may decide to inform users, even if consent was given. This may be the case for certain monitoring or security tools (users who knowingly install such programs can dismiss these warnings). Other risks, such as &ldquo;installing by security exploit&rdquo; may warrant automatic detection, no matter what other consent was given.</p>
<p>Some risk factors may be minor, and not enough to warrant detection on their own. However, the low-risk behaviors can help differentiate two similar programs, or may be combined into a higher risk level if enough low-risk behaviors are present. Anti-Spyware vendors may use confirmed user feedback as a part of their investigation into a risk factor.</p>
<p>Note that installation method varies not only from program to program, but also by affiliate and in some cases even by campaign. We rate and classify software based primarily on behaviors inherent in the software itself. In cases where installation has been observed via intrusive, covert or exploitative measures, this fact is taken into account by each Anti-Spyware vendor according to its policy.</p>
<p>The risk factors have general weights (High, Medium and Low) that help show the relative impact to the user. Although all behaviors can be problematic if unauthorized, certain ones tend to have a greater impact and are treated with more severity than others.</p>
<p>The list below is a combined set of the behaviors that members of the Anti-Spyware Coalition consider in their analysis. Each Anti-Spyware vendor weighs the behaviors as they see fit in their modeling formula.</p>

<h2>Behavior that may impact users / Relative Impact</h2>
<h3>Installation &amp; Distribution, including but not limited to:</h3>
<p>Replication behavior (mass-mailing, worming, or viral) High<br>
  Installs without user&rsquo;s explicit permission or knowledge, such as not providing or ignoring user&rsquo;s request to cancel installation, drive-by installation, use of a security exploit, or software that meets other risk factors and is undisclosed in a software bundle (Note: The rating of High indicates a typical rating for this item and its relative risk. The specific weight may vary depending on the severity.) High</p>
<p>Uninstalls other applications, such as competitive programs High<br>
  Software updates automatically Medium<br>

  Program downloads or installs software that has potentially unwanted behavior, as described in definitions document (Reminder: The rating of High indicates a typical rating for this item and its relative risk. The specific weight may vary depending on the severity or amount of items installed.) High</p>
<h3>Identification &amp; Control, including but not limited to</h3>
<p>Has incomplete or inaccurate identifying information Medium<br>
  Program obfuscated with tools that make it difficult to identify, such as a packer Medium<br>
  No indication the program is running inside an application, such as an icon, toolbar or window Low<br>
  No indication the program is running standalone, such as a taskbar, window or tray icon Low<br>

  Program runs automatically without explicit user consent Low</p>
<h3>Networking, including but not limited to:</h3>
<p>Proxies, redirects or relays the user&rsquo;s network traffic or modifies the networking stack High<br>
  Creates or modifies &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; file to divert domain reference without user permission or knowledge at time of change High<br>
  Changes default networking settings (Broadband, telephony, wireless, etc.) High<br>

  Dials phone numbers or holds open connections without user permission or knowledge. High<br>
  Alters the default internet connection to connect at a premium rate (i.e. 2x normal rate) High</p>
<h3>Data Collection, including but not limited to:</h3>
<p>Transmits personally identifiable data (Reminder: Technologies are neutral, and only a concern when abused. A behavior can be acceptable with notice and consent). High<br>
  Collects personal information, but stores it locally Medium<br>
  Intercepts communication, such as email or IM conversations (without appropriate notice and consent) High<br>
  Uploads arbitrary data, some of which could be personally identifiable Medium<br>

  Uploads data that can be used used to track user behavior offline and online as well as other types of data that may be sensitive, yet not personally identifiable Low<br>
  Uses tracking cookies to collect information (Reminder: Each Anti-Spyware vendor weighs a behavior according to their own policy. ASC recommends that vendors that utilize this criteria make it clear to users that they do so, affording users the opportunity to make an informed marketplace decision) Low</p>
